#Restapp
Restapp is a simple single page application (SPA) which communicates with a RESTful backend.


The applications demonstrates a trivial Company-Owner relationship.
Due to time constraints, in this implementation, an owner can only be associated with one company. i.e. It is not a many-to-many relationship. Futhermore (in the interface anyway), an owner cannot be created before a Company is created .

Spring Boot has been used to develop the restful backend. 
AngularJs has been used to develop the single page application. (The spring boot application is also used to serve up the angular app.)



## Backend
The backend was developed using Spring Boot which allows us to get basic web application, rest infrastructure and object relational mapping amongst others set up pretty quickly with minimal effort or code.

Some technologies of note auto configured by Spring boot:

- Hsqldb database : for simplicity , an in memory database is used to store Company and Owner information. Any data created/updated therefore will not survive a server restart. Spring Boot auto-configures an embedded HSQL database. You donâ€™t need to provide any connection URLs, simply include a build dependency to the embedded database that you want to use in the pom.xml maven build file.

- Spring Data JPA : part of the larger Spring Data family, makes it easy to easily implement a data access layer which allows our applications perform various database operations and also allows us to deal with the data in an object-relational manner.

- Spring Data Rest : builds on top of Spring Data repositories, analyzes the application's domain model and exposes hypermedia-driven HTTP resources for aggregates contained in the model.

The application uses [HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) as the primary representation format.

### REST services & cURL commands
examples below assume a server at localhost:8080
#### Get all companies  
```
curl localhost:8080/api/companies
```

This will return:

```javascript
{
  "_embedded" : {
    "companies" : [ {
      "name" : "Microsoft 0",
      "address" : "One Microsoft Way",
      "city" : "Redmond",
      "country" : "USA",
      "email" : "info@microsoft.com",
      "phoneNumber" : "(425) 703-62140",
      "_links" : {
        "self" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/companies/1"
        },
        "company" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/companies/1"
        },
        "owners" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/companies/1/owners"
        }
      }
    },.....
```
The service also offers paging and sorting although this is not used in the front end as yet e.g. http://localhost:8080/api/companies?page=0&size=10&sort=name,desc



#### Get a particular company

```
curl localhost:8080/api/companies/1
```
This will return:

```javascript
{
  "name" : "Microsoft 0",
  "address" : "One Microsoft Way",
  "city" : "Redmond",
  "country" : "USA",
  "email" : "info@microsoft.com",
  "phoneNumber" : "(425) 703-62140",
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/companies/1"
    },
    "company" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/companies/1"
    },
    "owners" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/companies/1/owners"
    }
  }
```

#### Create a company
```

curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{  "name" : "Apple",  "address" : "PA", "city":"SF", "country":"USA", "email":"info@apple.com", "phoneNumber":"1234567" }' http://localhost:8080/api/companies
HT

```
This will return:

```javascript
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Location: http://localhost:8080/api/companies/5
Content-Type: application/hal+json;charset=UTF-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Fri, 12 Feb 2016 17:40:46 GMT

{
  "name" : "Apple",
  "address" : "PA",
  "city" : "SF",
  "country" : "USA",
  "email" : "info@apple.com",
  "phoneNumber" : "1234567",
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/companies/5"
    },
    "company" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/companies/5"
    },
    "owners" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/companies/5/owners"
    }
  }
}
```

It can also return validation messages e.g.

```
url -i -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{ "email":"info@apple.com", "phoneNumber":"1234567" }' http://localhost:8080/api/companies
```

```
This will return:

```javascript
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Content-Type: application/hal+json;charset=UTF-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Fri, 12 Feb 2016 17:42:25 GMT
Connection: close

{
  "errors": [
    {
      "entity": "Company",
      "message": "may not be null",
      "invalidValue": "null",
      "property": "country"
    },
    {
      "entity": "Company",
      "message": "may not be null",
      "invalidValue": "null",
      "property": "name"
    },
    {
      "entity": "Company",
      "message": "may not be null",
      "invalidValue": "null",
      "property": "address"
    },
    {
      "entity": "Company",
      "message": "may not be null",
      "invalidValue": "null",
      "property": "city"
    }
  ]
}
```

The Angualr front end currently uses html5 client side validation on various fields.


#### Update a company

    }
  }
}
```

#### Delete an Owner
```
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/owners/1
```
This will return:

```javascript
204: No Content
```

#### ALPS
ALPS is a data format for defining simple descriptions of application-level semantics, similar in complexity to HTML micro-formats. It also supports adding its metadata to existing media types. As of version 2.2 M1, Spring Data REST exposes JSON based ALPS resources that can help us navigate its resources

```
http://localhost:8080/api/
```
returns
```javascript
{
  "_links" : {
    "owners" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/owners"
    },
    "companies" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/companies{?page,size,sort}",
      "templated" : true
    },
    "profile" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/profile"
    }
  }
```
At the root document are  links: owners, companies and profile. The client might not know what owners or companies mean, but the content contained inside profile is well defined. It basically points to a resource that describes the semantics of the resources on top of what the actual media type (HAL in this case) defines

e.g.
```
http://localhost:8080/api/companies
```

returns
```javascript
{
  "_embedded" : {
    "companies" : [ {
      "name" : "Microsoft 0",
      "address" : "One Microsoft Way",
      "city" : "Redmond",
      "country" : "USA",
      "email" : "info@microsoft.com",

        "self" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/companies/1"
        },
        "company" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/companies/1"
        },
        "owners" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/companies/1/owners"
        }
      }
    }, {
      "name" : "Microsoft 1",
      "address" : "One Microsoft Way",
      "city" : "Redmond",
      "country" : "USA",
      "email" : "info@microsoft.com",
      "phoneNumber" : "(425) 703-62141",
      "_links" : {
        "self" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/companies/2"
        },
        "company" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/companies/2"
        },
        "owners" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/companies/2/owners"
        }
      }
    }, {
      "name" : "Microsoft 2",
      "address" : "One Microsoft Way",
      "city" : "Redmond",
      "country" : "USA",
      "email" : "info@microsoft.com",
      "phoneNumber" : "(425) 703-62142",
      "_links" : {
        "self" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/companies/3"
        },
        "company" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/companies/3"
        },
        "owners" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/companies/3/owners"
        }
      }
    } ]
  },
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/companies"
    },
    "profile" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/api/profile/companies"
    }
  },
  "page" : {
    "size" : 20,
    "totalElements" : 3,
    "totalPages" : 1,
    "number" : 0
  }
}
```

## Frontend

When the main web application is accessed at "/", the default static/index.html page will be loaded. This page bootstraps the angularjs single page application, pulling in all the js and html files that it requires.

App uses angularjs 1.3.0-rc.2

The front end also uses Twitter Bootstrap - "he most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web"






## Considerations
### You do not need to add authentication to your web service, but propose a protocol / method and justify your choice?

I would propose a stateless token based authentication solution.

A token based implementation avoid the complexities of traditional server session approaches where sessions needed to either be replicated across a cluster of servers or 'sticky' sessions had to be used.
In a token based approach, there is no state held on the server, thus adding more server instances within a load balanced scenario becomes a lot less complex. 

Briefly - in a token based approach a client initially provides a username/password to the server, the server authenticates the user, and then issues the client with a unique token (can be expirable) that will be used in the header for all subsequent calls from client to server for to secured resources. Inside the server this token is mapped to a application user and usually held in a db table or fast key/value store/cache.

Depending on the application, one could implement a custom/simple token based authentication system or use an industry standard solution like OAuth2.

OAuth2 allows lots of options including the ability to authenticate via a third party authorization server like Facebook/Google/Twitter etc.
OAuth2 also allows the separation of an Authorization server and Resource server(s) thus allowing a common/central approach going forward for new applications within an organization. 


 

### How can you make the service redundant? What considerations should you do?

If we have a stateless approach with a token based authentication solution as mentioned previously then it is relatively easily to load balance multiple instances of the deployed application. With Amazon AWS Elastic Beanstalk for example, one can choose a load balancing configuration which automatically 'spins' up new instances of a server in the case of certain scenarios and/or thresholds being met - e.g if a server becomes unavailable or its CPU usage goes above a certain level.  The load balancer generally routes requests to different servers in the group in a round robin approach.

There are many other considerations when scaling an application for example one might scale the application across different world regions in the case of one region being down or oo far from the end user.  One also has to think about also scaling/replicating any persistent stores (e.g. databases) in these situations. 

Similarly there are things to think about in terms of message brokers/queues etc and scheduled jobs (e.g. one doesn't want the same job running on all instances of a server). In many cases IaaS services like Amazon AWS provide solutions for dealing with these problems. 

What considerations we have also depends on the design architecture. e.g. Do we have a monolithic application that deals with everything in one deployment or do we have a Microservices architecture. Whether one uses a monolithic or microservice architecture depends on the situation at hand.
In a microservice architecture we also have to make sure all components are 'up, configured correctly etc. Spring/Netflix have a lot of libraries to help with this e.g  Eureka (a registry for each service), Cloud Config and Cloud bus (for centralized and updateable configuration for all services) , Zuul (a common gateway to all the services) and Ribbon (for client side load balancing).
